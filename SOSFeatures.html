        <h3> Grid Sensors </h3>
        <p>
            On the bottom of the shelf with merchanise, regions of these gride 
            sensors will be applied per different item. There will be sensors beams 
            that line the bottom of the shelf along the x and y axis, as demonstrated 
            in the photo below. When all the beams resolve except for one (shown in 
            the 2nd and 3rd photo below), this means that there is low stock on this item. This 
            will trigger an alert on the worker's device. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Alert System </h3>
        <p>
            When the employee working a particular region gets alerted, the notification 
            on their device will be able to tell them which item is on low stock. The notification 
            will be able to pinpoint the aisle and item based on embedded code into the grid sensors. 
            Once the employee stocks the shelf, more than one sensor beam will break and therefore 
            resolve the notification if the user has not resolved it manually on their device.
