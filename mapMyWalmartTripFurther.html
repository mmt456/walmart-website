        <h3> Further Implemntation </h3>  
        <p>
            the "Map My Walmart Trip" Project is still in the ideation phase, and 
            therefore is far from being perfect. If Walmart decides to pick 
            up this project, I reccommend a few further implementations, however 
            furhter implementations are not limited to these few. 
        </p>

        <h3> Include Feature on Shopping Carts </h3>
        <p>
            To increase accessibility to those without phones or would rather 
            not use their phones, embedding hardware into some shopping carts 
            could be a good alternative for them. However, this does increase 
            the cost of development for the project.  
        </p>

        <h3> Include a "Call for Help" Button</h3>
        <p>
            Including a button to call for help anywhere along your trip can alert 
            a nearby worker your location. This can be helpful if an item has run 
            out of stock, or the feature has routed the customer incorrectly. This 
            may have constraints with customer privacy, however it does make calling 
            for help easier than trying to find someone in the store.
