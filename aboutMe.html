        Hello everyone! My name is Melinda Tran, and I am a rising Senior at the University 
        of Washington in Seattle. I am a first-generation-to-college student studying Electrical & Computer Engineering with a 
        concentration in Embedded Systems. I also have 2 minors: Education, and CSSE (Computer Science
        & Software Engineering). I am interested in making impact in the fields of the environment, 
        aerospace, and/or society. I also have a passion for teaching! I'm interested in a career in many 
        things like Embedded Systems, Software Engineering, and teaching.
