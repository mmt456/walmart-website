        <h2> Project "SOS - Save Our Shelves" </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Further Implementation: </h3>
        <p>
            The "SOS - Save our Shelves" Service is still in the ideation phase, and 
            therefore is far from being perfect. If Walmart decides to pick 
            up this project, I reccommend a few further implementations, however 
            furhter implementations are not limited to these few. 
        </p>

        <h3> Accomdate for A-Typically Designed Items</h3>
        <p>
            The current design for the grid sensors are installed on the based 
            of the shelf. However, for particuarlly strangly sized or arranged items 
            (ex. Lamps, spoons, fruits), the sensors may not accurately detect these 
            items. If more design and testing is put into the sensors, they could work 
            better for more items than just the ones with simple shapes. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Team Alert System </h3>
        <p>
            The current design for the alert system only alerts on person, however finding 
            a way to alert that one person as well as those nearby that a shelf has ran out of 
            stock can be beneficial to the project. This would also include the feature where if 
            one person resolves the notification on their device, everyone else that got alerted 
            will need their notification to resolve as well. Or, a way to mark a notification that 
            an employee is already working on that shelf, and show that mark to everyone is, would 
            serve a similar improvement.
