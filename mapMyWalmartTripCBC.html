        <h2> Project "Map My Walmart Trip" </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Costs: </h3> 
        <p>
            Costs for participating Walmart stores include the development 
            of the Walmart app. If this requries the cost for more employees 
            to work on the code development, than this project would include 
            that too. No extra costs are required in=store though. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Benefits: </h3>
        <p>
           This will greatly benefit the customers at Walmart as it makes 
           their shopping trips more organized and timely. In turn, this will 
           improve their customer experience and could improve Walmart's overall 
           reputation for accessibility. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Constraints: </h3>
        <p>
            There are several constraints this project. This project will only 
            be available to people who have phones and are able to navigate 
            the functionality well on the app (ex. older users may have trouble 
            learning how to use the new feature). Furtheremore, there is a lot overhead, 
            as developers will have to change the store mapping on the apps if they change 
            in the store. This may make this project infeasible all together, as code would 
            have to be changed in real time in order for customers to not be routed 
            to the wrong place while shopping.
