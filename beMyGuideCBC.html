        <h2> Project "Be My Guide" </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Costs: </h3> 
        <p>
            Participating Walmart stores will need to cover the cost of 
            a couple extra employees, and the cost of training for them 
            in working with people with differing abilities. Furthermore, 
            there is cost of the development behind the technology that 
            allows customers to request a guide, which will either through 
            Walmart App on their phone, or verbally when they arrive at Walmart.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Benefits: </h3>
        <p>
            Being more accessible to more audiences allows Walmart to increase 
            their profits made on in-store purchases. "Be My Guide" also promotes 
            a more welcoming environment to their customers with disabilities. Overall, 
            it makes the in-store Walmart experience more accessible, which can be 
            beneficial to Walmart's reputation and improve customer experience. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Constraints: </h3>
        <p>
            There are constraints if the cost of implementing this innovation is too high. 
            There are also constraints in the number of customers who can use a guide at a time. 
            If there are not enough guides for customers at a given hour, some customer will 
            be left with the challenge of navigating Walmart on their own. There is also 
            the possibility of the guide no knowing the same language as the customer. Even if 
            the guide is specifically hired knowing multiple languages, it can still be hard to 
            accomodate for how many people there are in a community.
