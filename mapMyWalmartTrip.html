            Project "Map My Walmart Trip" targets customers who either want to make 
            their trips to Walmart efficient, or have trouble finding items in walmart. 
            "Map My Walmart Trip" can be implmented on the Walmart App with a tab. The 
            app will show a general map of where you are in a particiapting Walmart store, 
            and allow you to list items on your shopping list. Then, the app will map the 
            customer through the most ideal route to pick up the items.

            This service will create more efficient and less stressful trips 
            to Walmart, improving their customer experience in participating stores. This 
            app can also lesson the stress on employees so they can use their time to 
            do something else than answer simple questions from customers.

            Large stores like Walmart often change organization, and it can be difficult 
            for customers to keep up. Particularly for those who don't go to Walmart often, 
            who are tight on time, or just have difficulty finding items for any reason, shopping 
            in stores like Walmart can be time consuming and stressful.
        </p>

        <h3> The Solution: </h3>
        <p>
            "Map My Walmart Trip" solves the listed problems byt utilizing shortest path
            algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, making it easier for users 
            to find their items and follow a route, similar to using a GPS. IT allows users to 
            be efficient with their time and minimizes the stress that comes with not being able 
            to find an item.
