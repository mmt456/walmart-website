        <h2> Project "Be My Guide" </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Project/Service Introduction: </h3>
        <p>
            Project "Be My Guide" targets the audience of those with disabilities
            that make shopping alone at Walmart less accessible. One example could
            be a person who is blind. "Be My Guide" is a purposed service that 
            participating Walmart stores will provide. Trained employees will act 
            Walmart guides to those who request one, and take the customer around
            the store to pick up their items.
            <br><br>
            This service builds Walmart's interpersonal presence, while making the
            shopping experience more accessible to an individual. "Be My Guide" 
            requires a few more employees to be hired per Walmart location, who can
            be trained in on-duty and off-duty tasks. On-duty task was described above,
            while off-duty tasks includes what a typical floor worker would be doing:
            stocking shelves, organizing merchanise, etc. More employees need to be hired, 
            as opposed to just training the existing ones, because these new employees 
            need to be available at a moments notice and will be occupied for long periods
            of time.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> The Problem: </h3>
        <p>
            Shopping in stores where the stock is constantly changing on the shelves,
            and the store layout can be different day to day, can be inaccessible to 
            those who have dissabilities that make finding merchanise more difficult. 
            As a result, this group of poeple may have a bad shopping experience, or 
            shop at other places all together. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> The Solution: </h3>
        <p>
            "Be My Guide" create a more personable experience by providing a guide 
            to those who request one, allowing those customers to feel more welcome 
            in participating Walmart stores. They're shopping experience will be better 
            as well, since they have a guide to take them to items in the store. "Be My Guide" 
            benefits Walmart as it promotes a better interpersonal presence for Walmart, 
            as well as the customers who find Walmart inaccessible due to differing abilities.
