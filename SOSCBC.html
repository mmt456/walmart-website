        <h2> Project "SOS:" Save Our Shelves </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Costs: </h3>  
        <p>
            The costs of Project "SOS" will include the hardware that's implemented 
            onto the shelves. The hardware includes components like sensors, wires, and 
            some form of power. There is also cost of implementation, to embed code into 
            the hardware, as well as allow the sensors to sync with the workers' devices to 
            alert them. There is no cost in hiring more employees, however there could be some 
            cost in the time it takes to train the employees how to use the new technology.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Benefits: </h3>
        <p>
            Benefits, as emphasized before, include the increased efficiency of workers 
            who restock shelves. Project "SOS" can also save them on some stress that comes 
            with having empty shelves for too long. This project benefits the customers as well, 
            making their time at Walmart simplier as the shelves will be empty less often. In turn, 
            this can benefit the Walmart company as whole, by creating a neater, more peaceful 
            atmosphere in their stores, growing their reputation. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Constraints: </h3>
        <p>
            These sensors will only work with items that are packed uniformly, which include (but 
            are not limited to): boxes, bottles, cartons, and cans. Items like fresh produce 
            will not be able to use these sensors effectively. 

            <br><br>
            Another contraint includes if customers mess with the sensors or the way the items are 
            stocked. Although the hardware can be designed to accomdate many different scenarios, 
            it is still hard to guess what an uncontrolled environment will do. 

            <br><br>
            Finally, there is constraint in the amount of overhead the coding of the 
            embedded hardware would require. As shelves change organization, the hardware 
            implanted into them will need to be re-coded and/or rearranged to fit the new item. 
            Even as store layout changes, like changing aisles, this will mean developeres will have to 
            re-code the hardware again.
