        <h3>Walmart App Tab: </h3>
        <p>
            A tab on the Walmart app will be dedicated to the "Be My Guide" service. 
            This tab will allow the users to request a guide for the time they will be 
            at Walmart. There will also be a comments section that allows the user to input 
            anything necessary about the trip, for instance what language the person 
            prefers to speak in. The app will be able to confirm that there is or is not 
            a guide for them at that time. If there is, the request will go through. If there 
            is not, recommendations for other times will be shown to the user.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> In Store Request: </h3>
        <p>
            For customers who prefer to not make requests on the Walmart app, they 
            can request a guide on the spot at participating Walmart stores. Walmart stores 
            can either post an employee at the entraces for people to ask for a guide, or 
            handle the requests at the customer service desk.
