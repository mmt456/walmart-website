        <h2> Project "SOS:" Save Our Shelves </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Project/Service Introduction: </h3>
        <p>
            Project "Save Our Shelves," (or "SOS"), is an innovation that 
            aids the workers at Walmart by alerting them when shelves in the 
            region they are managing are low on stock. This projects makes use 
            of sensors on shelves with uniformly packed items (the aisles sections), 
            as well as connection to a worker's device the ping them with a notification.
            <br><br>
            This project will increase the efficiey of restocking shelves throughout 
            the day. Particulary for items on sale or run out of stock frequently, this 
            can also improve customer experience, as customers will not have to ask 
            employees for more stock as often. This can also lead to decreases stress for 
            the employee, as it helps them to better prioritize their time in telling them 
            what shelves are most important to stock at the moment.
            
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> The Problem: </h3>
        <p>
            Many large stores with workers that are spread thin can run into 
            problems with shelves not being stocked for long periods of time. Walmart 
            is no exception to this. If shelves run out of stock during the day, it can 
            cause customers to become upset and therefore damage their experience at Walmart. 
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> The Solution </h3>
        <p>
            Project "SOS" allows workers to better prioritize 
            which shelves to stock, so even if they are spread thin on some days, most shelves 
            will be handled. Therefore, both workers and customers can be more at peace 
            when it comes to finding a shelf with no items on it.
