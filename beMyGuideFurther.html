        <h2>Project "Be My Guide" </h2>
        <br>

        <h3> Further Implementation </h3>  
        <p>
            the "Be My Guide" Service is still in the ideation phase, and 
            therefore is far from being perfect. If Walmart decides to pick 
            up this project, I reccommend a few further implementations, however 
            further implementations are not limited to these few. 
        </p>

        <h3> Memory for the Same User </h3>
        <p>
            Is a customer regularly requests a guide specifically on the Walmart 
            App, the same account should be able to use pre-defined comments that 
            include what the customer needs from a guide. This will speed up the 
            time it takes for the user to make a request, as well as improve their overall 
            user experiences (especially if using a phone is difficult for them).
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3> Train Other Workers </h3>
        <p>
            The Walmart shopping experience includes so many different workers and 
            and customers. Even with a guide, there are limitations as to what a guide 
            could legally be able to do. For instance, a guide probably should not handle 
            a customer's credit card. Therefore, other Walmart workers like cashiers may 
            need to be trained as well in order to make the entire shopping experience more 
            accessible to everyone.
